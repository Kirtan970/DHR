            <p>I want to sincerely apologize for my behavior last night during our chat. I realize that I was rude and that my words may have hurt you. It was completely unacceptable, and I deeply regret it.</p>
            <p>I really love u lot, and I value our friendship more than anything. Please know that I am truly sorry for my actions, and I am committed to making things right.</p>
            <p>Adding more from my heart ❤️‍🔥, I miss our laughter and conversations, and I don't want my mistake to come between us.</p>
            <p>Once again, I am sorry, Dhruvi. You Lasan Please forgive me.</p>
